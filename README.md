# coders_board

this is my Coders_Board project where i use Autohotkey for my daily hotkeys and macros and share the files here

if any of the files are useful to you TAKE THEM i already have them

overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
there are [x] files in the repo the main one(coders_board.ahk) 
two dials which sorround the moust when AppsKey's clicked, there's the simple version which only has "mail dial", it input's whatever email you'd like though you will need to do it manually because i can't get an install script working

The installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the main script is coders_board.ahk, place it whereever you'd like though the startup folder is recommended
